# zBot
zBot is a revolutionary **free cross-platform replay bot** developed by [fig](https://github.com/figmentboy)! zBot guarantees a high level of accuracy in creating and replaying macros **without** compromising Geometry Dash's vanilla playback physics.

## Capabilities
- Comprehensive macro recording utilities, including practice fixes, a built-in speedhack, and frame advance
- Real-time macro playback at any framerate
- Cross-platform macro sharing, with support for Windows, Mac, and iOS (through [camila314's iCreate](https://icreate.pro/))

## Support/Bugs
If you encounter any bugs while using zBot or if you'd like to open a support ticket for any reason, you can contact us in the [fig's shack discord server](https://discord.gg/fgWfJdrvdz).

## Pro Version Information
