# zBot
zBot is a revolutionary **free cross-platform replay bot** developed by [fig](https://github.com/figmentboy)! zBot guarantees a high level of accuracy in creating and replaying macros **without** compromising Geometry Dash's vanilla playback physics.

## Capabilities
- Comprehensive macro recording utilities, including practice fixes, a built-in speedhack, and frame advance
- Real-time macro playback at any framerate
- Cross-platform macro sharing, with support for Windows, Mac, and iOS (through [camila314's iCreate](https://icreate.pro/))

## License information
The provided version of zBot fully encompasses all of zBot's recording and playback features, with the notable omission of the zKeyChecker files. While you are permitted to build and modify the source on your own device, zBot's [license](LICENSE) does not permit the distribution of such builds.
